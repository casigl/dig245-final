<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial">To
see a baboon in your dream suggests that you need to be more expressive in your
feelings. You need to be more direct in telling others how you feel. On the
hand, it could be saying that you are expressing yourself in an inappropriate
manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial">In
particular, dreaming of a white baboon means that you are completely devoid of

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><b><a name="Baby"><font size="4" color="#000000" face="Arial">Baby</font></a></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see a baby in your dream signifies innocence, warmth and new beginnings.&nbsp;
Babies symbolize something in your own inner nature that is pure, vulnerable,
helpless and/or uncorrupted. If you dream that the baby is smiling at you, then
it suggests that you are experiencing pure joy. You do not ask for much to make
you happy.</font> <font face="Arial"> If you find a baby in your dream, then it suggests
that you have acknowledged your hidden potential. If you dream that you forgot
you had a baby, then it suggests that you are trying hide your own
vulnerabilities; you do not want to let others know of your weaknesses.
Alternatively, forgetting about a baby represents an aspect of yourself that you
have abandoned or put aside due to life's changing circumstances. The dream may
serve as a reminder that it is time for you to pick up that old interest, hobby,
or project again. Dreaming of holding a baby is analogous to holding onto an
earlier part of yoru life where you felt more depended on and more needed.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">If
you dream that you are on your way to the hospital to have a baby, then it
signifies your issues of dependency and your desires to be completely cared for.
Perhaps you are trying to get out of some responsibility. If you are pregnant in
real life, then a more direct interpretation may simply mean that you are
experiencing some anxieties of making it to the hospital when the time comes.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream of a crying baby symbolizes a part of yourself that is deprived of
attention and needs to be nurtured. Alternatively, it represents your
unfulfilled goals and a sense of lacking in your life. If you dream that a baby
is neglected, then it suggests that you are not paying enough attention to
yourself. You are not utilizing your full potential. Alternatively, this dream
could represent your fears about your own children and your ability to protect
and to provide for them.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream about a starving baby represents your dependence on others. You are
experiencing some deficiency in your life that needs immediate attention and
gratification.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see yourself or someone as a baby in your dream refers to your desire to be
cared for and nurtured. Alternatively, the dream may mean that you or someone is
behaving immaturely.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream that a baby is walking or dancing refers to the potential and
possibilities that life has in stored for you. The future looks bright. The
dream may also be a metaphor that you need to take baby steps in your
relationship, toward your goal, in a work project or whatever undertaking. If
you have a baby in real life, then the dream is a reflection of your hopes for
that baby.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream of an extremely small baby symbolizes your helplessness and your fears of
letting others become aware of your vulnerabilities and incompetence. You may be
afraid to ask for help and as a result tend to take matters into your own hands.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see a dead baby in your dream symbolizes the ending of something that was once a
part of you. If you dream that you are trying to snort up a dead baby, then it
means that you are refusing to move onto a new stage of life. You are holding
onto a dead past.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream that you are dipping a baby in and out of water sig<font size="3">nifies
regression. You are regressing to a time where you had no worries and
responsibilities. Alternatively, such a scenario is reminisce of when the baby
is in the fetus and in its comfort zone. In fact, some expectant mothers even
give birth in a pool, because the environment in the water mimics the
environment in the uterus. It is less traumatic for the baby as it emerges into
the world. So perhaps, the dream represents your search for your own comfort
zone.</font></font><font face="Arial" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">Dreaming of rescuing a drowning baby means that you are
allowing yourself to be vulnerable and accepting help from others.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">If
you dream of having or adopting a baby of a different race, then it means that
you are acknowledging and/or embracing other's physical differences.<font face="Arial" size="3">
</font>Everyone started out as a baby who is pure and innocent. </font><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Seeing
an evil baby or a demon baby in your dream implies that you are apprehensive or
afraid of a new project that you are undertaking. You may be taking on more than
you can handle. If you dream that a baby has a third eye on the back of the
head, then it means getting caught.&nbsp; You are acting carelessly when you
think no on is watching.&nbsp; <a href="#Top"><font face="Arial" size="2">TOP</font></a></font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream about the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain
aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this
person special or what you like about them. It is that very quality that you are
lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, the dream
indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life
anymore.&nbsp;In particular, to dream about the death of your living parents indicates
that you are undergoing a significant change in your waking life. Your
relationship with your parents has evolved into a new realm.&nbsp;If you dream
about the death of a child, then it implies that you need to let go of your
immaturity and start being more serious. As your child reaches certain
milestones and grows into an adult, dreaming of their death may be symbolic of
their own self-discovery, transition and transformation into a new stage of
life.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To

dream indicates that you are being given a second chance or second try at
something.</font></p>

dream that you die in your dream symbolizes inner changes, transformation,
self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or your
life. You are undergoing a transitional phase and are becoming more enlightened
or spiritual. Although such a dream may bring about feelings of fear and
anxiety, it is no cause for alarm as it is often considered a positive symbol.&nbsp;
Dreams of experiencing your own death usually means that big changes are ahead
for you. You are moving on to new beginnings and leaving the past behind. These
changes does not necessarily imply a negative turn of events. Metaphorically,
dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways and habits. So,
dying does not always mean a physical death, but an ending of something.<font size="3">
If you dream that someone is telling you that you are going die, then it implies
that you are being pressured to make an important change or choice. You are
about to embark on some new life adventure.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">If
a love one has past away, but you dream that he or she didn't really die that
first time and are being buried again indicates that this loved one was taken
before their time and you never got a chance to say a proper good bye. Perhaps
there was some unfinished issue that is still left lingering long after their
death. You wished you had a little more time with them.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">On a
negative note, to dream that you die may represent involvement in deeply painful
relationships or unhealthy, destructive behaviors. You may feeling depressed or
feel strangled by a situation or person in your waking life. Perhaps your mind
is preoccupied with someone who is terminally ill or dying. Alternatively, you
may be trying to get out of some obligation, responsibility or other situation.
You are desperately trying to escape from the demands of your daily life.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see someone dying in your dream signifies that your feelings for that person are
dead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with
that person. Alternatively, you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that
is represented by the dying person. If you see a stranger die in your dream,
then it implies that you are feeling detached from the changes that are
happening around you.&nbsp;</font></p>
