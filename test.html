<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream about sex refers to the integration and merging of contrasting aspects of
yourself. It represents psychological completion. You need to be more receptive
and incorporate aspects of your dream sex partner into your own character.
Consider the nature of the love-making. Was it passionate? Was it slow? Was it
wild? The sex act parallels aspects of yourself that you wish to express. A more
direct interpretation of the dream may be your libido's way of telling you that
it has been too long since you have had sex.&nbsp;It may indicate repressed
sexual desires and your needs for physical and emotional love.&nbsp;If you are
looking for a place to have sex, then the dream may be analogous to your search
for intimacy and closeness. You want to rekindle some relationship. If you dream
of having sex in a public place, then the dream implies that others are talking
about your private relationship. Dreaming of having sex on a ship refers to
emotional intimacy. Perhaps the dream is telling you that you are just going
through the physical aspects of sex, but are lacking the emotional connection.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream about sex with someone other than your spouse or significant other
suggests dissatisfaction with the physical side of your relationship. On the
other hand, it may be harmless fantasy. In such situations, you may find that
you are less inhibited sexually. Perhaps you need to bring the same sense of
adventure into your existing relationship.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream that you are having sex with an ex or someone who is not your current mate
denotes your reservations about embarking in a new relationship or situation.
You may feel nervous ab<font size="3">out exposing yourself and are feeling a
resurgence of those old emotions and feelings that you felt back when you and
your ex were together. If you are approaching your wedding date, then is not
uncommon to experience especially erotic adventures with partners other than
your intended spouse. This may be due to the intensity of the sexual passion
with your fiancé. It also relates to the new roles that you will be
taking on and the uncertainty that that may bring.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you are having sex with a stranger represents uncertainty about what
is ahead. Alternatively, the dream allows you to experiment freely without
having any hang ups, emotional baggage or preconceived notions associated with a
person you would know. In such a scenario, you are able to let loose and express
your desires, passions and emotions. In particular, if you dream of having sex
with multiple partners at the same time, then it indicates that you are feeling
detached in your personal relationship. You feel that sex is just an act devoid
of any emotion or passion. Perhaps your sex life has become too automated.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream that you are having sex with a friend refers to the closeness you share
with your friend. Because you two share so much between each other and know so
much about each other, the dreaming mind may depict this closeness as sex.
Alternatively, such a dream indicates a level of attraction between you and your
friend, but you are too afraid to act on it. Thus your desires are manifested in
a dream.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font face="Arial">If
you are heterosexual and you dream that you are having sex with someone of the

You need to be in better touch of your feminine or masculine side. The dream
does not necessarily imply homosexual desire.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To

have.</font></p>
